# Hydra_CalciumImaging_Analysis
A Pipeline for the automated analysis of calcium imaging data from Hydra Vulgaris.

This package allows the automated extraction of calcium imaging data - such as relative fluorescence and deconvolved spike times - from our 2-colour line of Hydra Vulgaris.

This allows large datasets of activity from hundreds of neurons to be generated, and the package provides many tools to aid in the visualization of this data and the many correlations which may occur within these datasets.
